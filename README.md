This program takes in a csv file with the variables last name, first name, middle initial, ID, and Phone Number and processes the text. The text processing seems to work well with python, as I didn't have to import a ton of libraries like most python projects. I have used python before, but I am new to using python with sysarg and the terminal. To run the program, you type in the terminal "python filepath textfile".
